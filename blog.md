# Building Covey

## Introduction

Throughout my life, writing has been a great mechanism for clarifying and solidifying my thoughts. So, I have decided to experiment with documenting the process of building a piece of software in writing. I am interested to see how writing about my experience might improve my engineering process. At a minimum, I think it will force me to be more deliberate about design choices. I'll have to justify any decisions I make to whatever fictional or real audience I have, which I imagine will have a real refining effect on my decisions. While building readership is not my main priority, I would be thrilled if something I write here ends up being useful or entertaining for someone.

## Why Covey?

I am writing in the now empty second bedroom of my apartment near the campus of Brigham Young University in Provo, UT. My two roommates who occupied this room have returned home to weather the COVID-19 storm with their families. Despite their leaving, I made the choice to stay here. The hope that I could maintain some sort of structure in my life was no small part of that decision. Despite my efforts, I regretfully report that all semblance of order is rapidly vanishing. This is where the idea for Covey comes in. I need a way to stay structured and productive.

One of the most productive periods of my life was a couple of years ago when I was just starting college. One of my classes required us to read *The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People* by Stephen R. Covey. The book had a profound impact on the way I directed my life. In short, it made me more deliberate about setting priorities. One of Covey's teachings that resonated with me centered around a 4x4 matrix that separates out different categories of priorities.
